To use the icon without downloading, Just click on the desired icon and press `Copy permalink` from the option menu. You will get a link. You just have to replace the `https://github.com/Shariar-Hasan/ProGos/blob/` portion of the url with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shariar-Hasan/ProGos/`. Or you can just right click on the icon and copy image link. Its better to fork the repository on your own account, and then use the permalink, so any future update on main repository wont effect your link **_(In that case, carful about the username of the repository, it to be yours)_** 😁
